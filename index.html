            When I was here i caught nothing but somebody else caught a trout.
            <br>
            There are not a lot of shore fishing spots and the boat launch is hard to get to, and there are a lot of big pot holes and a very windy road down to the lake.
            <br>
            there are a lot of snags and under water strucktures at this lake, becuase of that i would recomend a top water bait like a frog or a crank bait fly fishing is also very populre at this lake.(these are the frogs and crank baits i use)

            there is a nice selection of fish at this lake better than most, includeing bass crappie bluegill and to many trout. id give this lake 7/10.</p>

    I like this lake but the water quality is poor so i do not recemond to keep fish out of this lake..
    when i was hear i caught 4 bass and a faimly record trout (4.5 lbs).
This is a lake with lots of shore accses. any lure will work at this lake for a few resonns first one is there arent many snags
and bass will eat any thing that will fit in it's mouth. I think smiw baits work the best though.
Some other lure options for this lake would be this,

if you are just fishing to catch and release this is a great, spot I dont think you should keep fish from this lake.

<br>
<br>
Hoags pond is very tiny. Its a nice pond with one species of fish, witch is bluegill.
<br> 
so you will want to use small lures, like a small minnow with a bright jig head, or just a worm on a hook.
at this pond use 4 pound test for your line. It is hard to cast at this pond because of all of the tree overhang and shrubs, so use your small rod.

<br>
Shore accses is fine but are hard to fish for the same ressons i mentioned. 

<br>
if you do decide to fish hear be prepared to snag many times, 6
/10.

<br>
this is a good lake for trout fishing.
<br>
this is a very deep lake so it takes a bit for your lure to sink, it gets to be 140 feet deep but alot of the trout and perch are close to shore.
<br>
The catfish are deeper though, kokanee salmon, largemouth and smallmouth bass are at this lake to.
<br>
There is not great shore access for this lake but there is a dock and a boat launch 
<br>
i did not snag while i was at this lake, but i did not catch any fish when i went to this lake
<br>
 i did see another fisherman catch 3 or 4 trout.
 <br>                                                                               
as for lures i like inland sppiners work the best.
