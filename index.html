          When I was here I caught nothing but another guy that was at the lake caught a trout.
          <br>
          There is only one publick shore access and the boat launch is hard to get to for most boats. There are a lot of big pot holes and a very windy road down to the shore access.
          <br>
          there are a lot of snags and under water strucktures at this lake, becuase of that i would recomend a top water bait like a frog or a crank bait fly fishing is also very populre at this lake.(these are the frogs and crank baits i use)

          The lake is very nice if you swim hear watch out for hooks in the mud. two of my friends have goten stuck i the mud.             there is a nice selection of fish at this lake better than most, includeing bass crappie bluegill and to many trout. id give this lake 7/10.

    I like this lake but the water quality is poor so i do not recemond keeping fish out of this lake.
    <br>   
    when i was hear i caught 4 bass and a faimly record trout (4.5 lbs). This is a lake with lots of shore accses. any lure will work at this lake for a few resonns first one is there arent many snags and bass will eat any thing that will fit in it's mouth.
    <br>
    if you are just fishing to catch and release this is a great, spot I dont think you should keep fish from this lake.
    <br>
    I think smiw baits work the best though. Some other lure options for this lake would be the

    <br>
    <br>
    Hoags pond is very tiny. Its a nice pond with one species of fish, witch is bluegill.
    <br>
    so you will want to use small lures, like a small minnow with a bright jig head, or just a worm on a hook. at this pond use 4 pound test for your line. It is hard to cast at this pond because of all of the tree overhang and shrubs, so use your small rod.

    Shore accses is fine but are hard to fish for the same ressons i mentioned.
    <br>
    if you do decide to fish hear be prepared to snag many times, 6 /10.

    <br>
    this is a good lake for trout fishing.
    <br>
    this is a very deep lake so it takes a bit for your lure to sink, it gets to be 140 feet deep but alot of the trout and perch are close to shore.
    <br>
    The catfish are deeper though, kokanee salmon, largemouth and smallmouth bass are at this lake to.
    <br>
    There is not great shore access for this lake but there is a dock and a boat launch
    <br>
    i did not snag while i was at this lake, but i did not catch any fish when i went to this lake
    <br>
    i did see another fisherman catch 3 or 4 trout.
    <br>
    as for lures i like inland sppiners work the best.
